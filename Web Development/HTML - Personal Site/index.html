        <p><em>Writer and Managing Editor of <strong><a href="http://mironline.org/">MIROnline.org</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>Peter grew up in a small town near Oxford and spent his youth trying to escape it. He took flight by studying Japanese literature, first in London, then Japan and finally in the Netherlands. It was during this time that his desire to
          create his
          own stories became an overwhelming compulsion which eventually drew him back to London. There he did an MA Creative Writing at Birkbeck University and graduated with distinction. Since then, he has explored his newfound voice, helping him
          to be
          shortlisted for the Wasafiri New Writing Prize, 2018, to become the Managing Editor of the literary magazine The Mechanics’ Institute Review and an awardee of Spread the Word’s London Writers Awards, 2019/2020. He is currently working on
          his
          debut novel Static, exploring his brother’s severe autism, the death of his father, and the life he left behind.</p>
